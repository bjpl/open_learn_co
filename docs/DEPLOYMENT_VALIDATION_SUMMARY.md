# OpenLearn Colombia - Deployment Validation Suite

## Overview
Comprehensive deployment validation and load testing infrastructure created for ensuring production-ready deployments with automated quality gates and rollback capabilities.

## 📦 Deliverables Created

### 1. Pre-Deployment Test Suite
**Location**: `/tests/deployment/pre_deployment.py`

**Validates**:
- ✅ Environment variables configuration
- ✅ Database connectivity and migrations
- ✅ Redis cache connectivity
- ✅ Elasticsearch connectivity (optional)
- ✅ Django security settings
- ✅ Python dependencies compatibility
- ✅ Migration status
- ✅ Static files collection

**Usage**:
```bash
# Direct execution
python tests/deployment/pre_deployment.py

# Via validation script
./scripts/deployment/validate-deployment.sh pre staging
```

**Exit Codes**:
- `0`: All validations passed
- `1`: One or more validations failed

---

### 2. Post-Deployment Smoke Tests
**Location**: `/tests/deployment/post_deployment.py`

**Tests**:
- ✅ Health endpoint availability
- ✅ Database connectivity through API
- ✅ Redis cache functionality
- ✅ Search functionality
- ✅ Authentication flow
- ✅ Static files accessibility
- ✅ Critical API endpoints
- ✅ Response time performance
- ✅ Error handling (404, etc.)

**Usage**:
```bash
# Test staging
DEPLOYMENT_URL=https://staging.openlearn.colombia python tests/deployment/post_deployment.py

# Test production
DEPLOYMENT_URL=https://openlearn.colombia python tests/deployment/post_deployment.py

# Via validation script
./scripts/deployment/validate-deployment.sh post production
```

**Performance Targets**:
- Average response time: < 1.0s
- API endpoints: 100% responding
- Error rate: < 1%

---

### 3. Load Testing with Locust
**Location**: `/tests/load/locustfile.py`

**User Classes** (5 types):
1. **OpenLearnUser** (50% traffic) - General browsing
2. **AuthenticationUser** (20% traffic) - Login/logout flows
3. **SearchHeavyUser** (15% traffic) - Search operations
4. **DashboardUser** (10% traffic) - Dashboard interactions
5. **ApiHeavyUser** (5% traffic) - API batch requests

**Load Profile** (StepLoadShape):
- Step 1: 100 users (0-2 min)
- Step 2: 300 users (2-4 min)
- Step 3: 600 users (4-6 min)
- Step 4: 1000 users (6-9 min) ← **Peak load**
- Step 5: 500 users (9-11 min) - Cool down

**Performance Targets**:
- p50 response time: < 200ms
- **p95 response time: < 500ms** ← Critical SLA
- p99 response time: < 1000ms
- Failure rate: < 1%
- Throughput: 100+ req/sec

**Usage**:
```bash
# Interactive mode (local development)
locust -f tests/load/locustfile.py --host http://localhost:8000

# Headless mode (automated)
locust -f tests/load/locustfile.py \
  --host https://staging.openlearn.colombia \
  --users 1000 \
  --spawn-rate 10 \
  --run-time 5m \
  --headless \
  --html load-test-report.html

# Via load testing script
./scripts/deployment/run-load-tests.sh staging 1000 10m
```

**Distributed Testing** (for 10k+ users):
```bash
# Master node
locust -f tests/load/locustfile.py --master --expect-workers 4

# Worker nodes (x4)
locust -f tests/load/locustfile.py --worker --master-host=<master-ip>
```

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements-test.txt
```

### 2. Run Pre-Deployment Validation
```bash
./scripts/deployment/validate-deployment.sh pre local
```

### 3. Run Load Tests Locally
```bash
# Start Django server
python manage.py runserver

# Run load tests
./scripts/deployment/run-load-tests.sh local 100 2m
```

### 4. Deploy to Staging (via CI/CD)
```bash
# Push to develop branch
git checkout develop
git merge feature-branch
git push origin develop

# GitHub Actions automatically:
# - Validates deployment
# - Builds Docker image
# - Deploys to staging
# - Runs smoke tests
# - Runs load tests
```

### 5. Deploy to Production (manual approval)
```bash
# Push to main branch
git checkout main
git merge develop
git push origin main

# GitHub Actions workflow waits for approval
# After approval, automatically:
# - Creates database backup
# - Deploys to production
# - Runs smoke tests
# - Notifies team
```

### 6. Emergency Rollback
```bash
# If deployment fails
./scripts/deployment/rollback.sh production application
```
