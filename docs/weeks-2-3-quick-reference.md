## Test-First Development Workflow

### The TDD Cycle
```
1. RED:    Write failing test (define expected behavior)
2. GREEN:  Write minimal code to pass test
3. REFACTOR: Improve code quality
4. REPEAT: Move to next test
```

### Test Naming
```python
def test_<feature>_<scenario>_<expected_result>(self):
    """
    GIVEN: <preconditions>
    WHEN: <action>
    THEN: <expected outcome>
    """
```

---

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Coverage goal not met | Prioritize high-risk modules, extend timeline |
| Health checks blocked | Allocate senior dev, pair programming |
| Security issues found | Immediate fixes, delay launch if critical |
| Deployment fails | Test in staging, have manual fallback |
