================================================================================
CRITICAL FINDINGS
================================================================================

BLOCKER #1: El Tiempo Date Parsing Bug
  Location: backend/scrapers/sources/media/el_tiempo.py:238
  Severity: CRITICAL - Returns current datetime for ALL articles
  Type: Code bug, not dependent on site inspection
  Fix Time: 15-30 minutes
  Impact: ALL scraped articles have wrong publication dates
  Action: FIX IMMEDIATELY - does not require verification

BLOCKER #2: Content Container Selectors (4 Scrapers)
  Files Affected:
    - backend/scrapers/sources/media/el_tiempo.py (line 39)
    - backend/scrapers/sources/media/el_espectador.py (line 46)
    - scrapers/semana_scraper.py (line 47)
    - scrapers/portafolio_scraper.py (line 47)
  Severity: CRITICAL - Cannot extract article content if selectors fail
  Type: Likely outdated CSS class names
  Status: Needs live site inspection to verify
  Fix Time: 2-3 hours per scraper
  Action: Parallel inspection of all 4 sites required

BLOCKER #3: Article Link Discovery (3 Scrapers)
  Files Affected:
    - backend/scrapers/sources/media/el_espectador.py (line 43)
    - scrapers/semana_scraper.py (line 44)
    - scrapers/portafolio_scraper.py (line 44)
  Severity: CRITICAL - Cannot discover articles if selectors fail
  Type: Component class names appear outdated
  Status: Needs homepage inspection to verify
  Fix Time: 1-2 hours per scraper
  Action: Parallel inspection and selector update needed

HIGH PRIORITY: Paywall Detection
  Severity: HIGH - Over-aggressive content filtering
  Issue: 200-300 character threshold creates false positives
  Solution: Remove length heuristic, use keyword-only detection
  Fix Time: 30 minutes per scraper

================================================================================
RECOMMENDED SWARM STRUCTURE
================================================================================

Team A: Critical Bug Fixes (1 Agent)
  Mission: Fix code bugs not dependent on verification
  Work: El Tiempo date parsing, fallback improvements
  Duration: 1-2 hours
  Parallelizable: Yes

Team B: Selector Verification & Update (2-3 Agents)
  Mission: Inspect live sites, verify/update selectors
  Work: Agent B1: El Tiempo + El Espectador-Backend
        Agent B2: Semana
        Agent B3: Portafolio
  Duration: 2-3 hours per scraper
  Parallelizable: Yes (independent per site)
  Dependencies: Browser/DevTools access

Team C: Testing & Validation (1 Agent)
  Mission: Verify fixes work against real articles
  Work: 3-5 articles per scraper, quality metrics
  Duration: 2 hours
  Depends On: Team B completion

Team D: Documentation & Integration (1 Agent)
  Mission: Finalize, update docs, coordinate integration
  Work: Consolidate changes, test cases, deployment prep
  Duration: 1 hour
  Depends On: All teams complete

Total Team Size: 5-6 agents (can scale)
Total Duration: 8-10 hours (parallel work: ~4 hours wall-clock)
Start Condition: Immediate (Phase 1 can begin now)

================================================================================
PHASE BREAKDOWN
================================================================================

PHASE 1: Parallel Reconnaissance (1-2 hours, Start Immediately)
  Team B inspects live websites
  - Screenshot actual HTML structure
  - Identify current class names for articles, titles, content, dates, authors
  - Note any CSS framework (Bootstrap, Tailwind, custom)
  - Document differences from current selectors
  Report: Findings shared with Team A & Team D

PHASE 2: Parallel Fixes (2-3 hours, After Phase 1)
  Team A: Bug fixes and improvements
    - Remove hardcoded current datetime fallback in El Tiempo
    - Improve paywall detection
    - Add better fallback chains
  Team B: Update selectors to match Phase 1 findings
  Both teams coordinate via shared documentation

PHASE 3: Testing & Validation (2 hours, After Phase 2)
  Team C: Tests all fixes
    - 3-5 real articles per scraper
    - Quality metrics verification
    - Success rate calculation
    - Issues documentation

PHASE 4: Integration (1 hour, After Phase 3)
  Team D: Finalizes integration
    - Consolidates all changes
    - Updates code comments
    - Creates/updates test cases
    - Prepares deployment package

Timeline: 6-8 hours implementation + 2 hours buffer = 8-10 hours total

================================================================================
INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY
================================================================================

El Tiempo (Backend)
  State: Functional but broken (date bug)
  Health: NEEDS IMMEDIATE FIX
  Difficulty: Easy (code bug, no verification needed)
  Estimate: 2-3 hours total

El Espectador - Root Version
  State: Better structured with regex patterns
  Health: NEEDS VERIFICATION
  Difficulty: Medium (pattern verification)
  Estimate: 2-3 hours

El Espectador - Backend Version
  State: Fragile, all class-based selectors
  Health: NEEDS UPDATE
  Difficulty: Medium-High (class-dependent)
  Estimate: 2-3 hours

Semana
  State: Complex but well-structured
  Health: NEEDS VERIFICATION
  Difficulty: Medium (selector verification)
  Estimate: 2-3 hours

Portafolio
  State: Clean, but questionable selectors
  Health: NEEDS VERIFICATION
  Difficulty: Medium (selector verification)
  Estimate: 2 hours

Best Implementation Pattern: Root El Espectador (regex-based URL patterns)
Worst Implementation: El Tiempo (hardcoded fallbacks, date bug)
Recommendation: Consider centralizing pattern into shared base class

================================================================================
QUALITY ASSURANCE CRITERIA
================================================================================

For each scraper fix to be COMPLETE, must pass:

1. Selector Verification (100% required)
   [ ] Tested against 3+ real articles from live site
   [ ] Title extracted correctly (not nav/breadcrumb)
   [ ] Content extracted completely (full article body)
   [ ] Author extracted or defaults correctly
   [ ] Date is actual publish date (not current)
   [ ] Links discovered successfully

2. Success Rate (≥90% required)
   [ ] Content extraction succeeds ≥90% of attempts
   [ ] Title extraction succeeds ≥90% of attempts
   [ ] Date extraction succeeds ≥90% of attempts
   [ ] No silent failures (all errors logged)

3. Edge Cases (80%+ required)
   [ ] Short articles handled (< 500 chars)
   [ ] Special characters handled (accents, symbols)
   [ ] Multiple authors handled
   [ ] Unusual date formats supported
   [ ] Byline/author prefixes cleaned

4. Code Quality
   [ ] Selectors documented in comments
   [ ] Why multiple selectors needed explained
   [ ] No hardcoded current datetime
   [ ] Error handling present
   [ ] Rate limiting respected

================================================================================
SUCCESS METRICS FOR COMPLETION
================================================================================

After all fixes complete, should achieve:

Extraction Success: ≥90% (across all 4 scrapers)
False Positives: <5% (wrong content extracted)
False Negatives: <10% (articles not found)
Date Accuracy: 100% (actual publish dates)
Performance: <5 seconds per article
Reliability: 0 silent failures

Track These Metrics:
- Success rate per scraper per round of testing
- False positive/negative rates
- Date parsing accuracy percentage
- Performance timing averages
- Error logging completeness
