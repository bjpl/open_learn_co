## INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY BY SCRAPER

### EL TIEMPO (Backend Implementation)
**Current State:** Functional but has bugs
**Critical Issues:**
- Date parsing always returns current date (line 238) - MUST FIX
- Content container selector outdated (needs verification)
**Good Parts:**
- Async support already implemented
- Colombian entity extraction good
- Difficulty scoring algorithm solid
**Estimated Fix Time:** 2-3 hours
**Fix Priority:** 1 (START HERE)

### EL ESPECTADOR (Two Implementations)
**Root Version State:** Better structured with regex patterns
**Backend Version State:** More fragile with class-based selectors
**Critical Issues (Both):**
- Article link selectors outdated (needs verification)
- Content container selectors outdated (needs verification)
**Recommendation:** Keep root version, consider deprecating backend version
**Estimated Fix Time:** 2-3 hours each
**Fix Priority:** 2 (Parallel with El Tiempo content fix)

### SEMANA
**Current State:** Most complex implementation with metadata extraction
**Critical Issues:**
- Article link selectors outdated (needs verification)
- Content container selectors outdated (needs verification)
- Promotional content filter may over-filter (needs tuning)
**Good Parts:**
- Best date parsing implementation
- Metadata extraction comprehensive
- Content quality threshold reasonable
**Estimated Fix Time:** 2-3 hours
**Fix Priority:** 2 (Parallel work)

### PORTAFOLIO
**Current State:** Clean implementation with session management
**Critical Issues:**
- Article link selectors questionable (needs verification)
- Content container selectors outdated (needs verification)
- Paywall detection doesn't stop processing
**Good Parts:**
- Multiple date extraction fallbacks
- Author extraction with cleanup
- Context manager pattern good
**Estimated Fix Time:** 2 hours
**Fix Priority:** 2 (Parallel work)

---

## INTER-AGENT COORDINATION POINTS

### Information Sharing Required

**Selector Updates** → Once verified on live sites:
- Document actual class names found
- Share patterns between Team B agents
- Update common base class if used

**Test Results** → After fixes complete:
- Share extraction success rates
- Document any edge cases found
- Report performance metrics

**Documentation** → Final integration:
- Consolidate findings into code comments
- Update selector documentation in each file
- Create test dataset of sample articles

---

## KNOWN DEPENDENCIES & CONSTRAINTS

### External Dependencies
- **Browser/DevTools Access:** Required for live site inspection (Phase 1)
- **Network Access:** Need to fetch live articles for testing
- **Python Environment:** All scrapers use Python with BeautifulSoup

### Internal Dependencies
- **El Tiempo Date Fix:** No dependencies, can be done independently
- **Content Selectors:** All depend on live site inspection first
- **Article Link Selectors:** Depend on homepage inspection
- **Testing Phase:** Depends on selector verification complete

### Potential Blockers
- **Website Changes:** If sites recently redesigned, more work needed
- **Paywall/Rate Limiting:** May need to work around protective measures
- **Meta Tags:** Some sites may not have proper og: meta tags
- **Schema.org:** Some sites may not implement structured data

---

## ESCALATION POINTS

If any agent encounters these issues, escalate to swarm coordinator:

1. **Website Blocked/Rate Limited**
   - May need proxy rotation or extended delays
   - Consider expanding sample articles to different times

2. **HTML Structure Completely Different**
   - Site may have done major redesign
   - May need to use different approach (JavaScript rendering, API)
   - Escalate for architectural review

3. **Selectors Can't Be Found**
   - May indicate site uses JavaScript to render content
   - Escalate for tool (Selenium, Playwright) evaluation

4. **Conflicting Selector Needs**
   - If two scrapers need different approaches
   - Escalate for pattern standardization

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

After all fixes complete:

- **Extraction Success Rate:** ≥ 90% across all 4 scrapers
- **False Positives:** < 5% (wrong content extracted)
- **False Negatives:** < 10% (articles not found/missed)
- **Date Accuracy:** 100% (matches actual publish date)
- **Performance:** < 5 seconds per article on average
- **Reliability:** 0 silent failures (all errors logged)

---
