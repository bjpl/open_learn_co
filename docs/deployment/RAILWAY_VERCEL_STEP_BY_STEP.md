## üéä **COMPLETE - YOU'RE LIVE!**

Your platform is now running at:
- **Frontend**: https://openlearn.vercel.app
- **Backend**: https://openlearn-production.up.railway.app
- **Database**: Supabase (automatic backups)
- **Email**: SendGrid (100/day free)

**Test everything**:
1. Open https://openlearn.vercel.app
2. Click "Sign Up"
3. Create account
4. Check email inbox (should receive welcome email)
5. Log in
6. Browse dashboard
7. Test all features

**If all works**: üéâ **LAUNCH SUCCESSFUL!**

---

## üîç **Troubleshooting**

### **Frontend won't connect to backend**:
```
Error in browser console: "Failed to fetch" or CORS error

Fix:
1. Verify Railway backend is running:
   https://YOUR-RAILWAY-URL.up.railway.app/health
   Should return: {"status":"healthy"}

2. Check Vercel environment variable:
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL should match Railway URL EXACTLY

3. Check Railway CORS:
   CORS_ORIGINS should include Vercel URL

4. Redeploy both:
   - Railway: Deployments ‚Üí Redeploy
   - Vercel: Deployments ‚Üí Redeploy
```

### **Database connection errors**:
```
Railway logs show: "could not connect to database"

Fix:
1. Verify Supabase connection string is correct
2. Check password has no special characters that need escaping
3. Test connection from Railway:
   Railway ‚Üí Your service ‚Üí Shell
   > python
   >>> from sqlalchemy import create_engine
   >>> engine = create_engine("YOUR_DATABASE_URL")
   >>> engine.connect()
   Should succeed
```

### **Emails not sending**:
```
Railway logs show: "SMTP authentication failed"

Fix:
1. Verify SendGrid API key is correct (starts with SG.)
2. Verify sender email is verified in SendGrid
3. Check SendGrid dashboard for send attempts
4. Restart Railway service: Deployments ‚Üí Redeploy
```
