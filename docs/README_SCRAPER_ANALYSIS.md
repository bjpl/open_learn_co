## Scraper Status Summary

| Scraper | Location | Status | Priority | Est. Fix Time |
|---------|----------|--------|----------|--------------|
| **El Tiempo** | `backend/scrapers/sources/media/el_tiempo.py` | Has Critical Bugs | 1 | 2-3 hrs |

## Critical Issues at a Glance

### Issue #1: El Tiempo Date Bug (BLOCKER)
- **Problem:** Returns current date for ALL articles
- **Location:** Line 238 in el_tiempo.py
- **Impact:** Critical - Makes all scraped dates wrong
- **Fix Difficulty:** Easy (remove hardcoded fallback)
- **Time:** 15-30 minutes

### Issue #2: Content Container Selectors (BLOCKING ALL)
- **Problem:** CSS class names likely outdated
- **Locations:** 4 scrapers
- **Impact:** Cannot extract article content
- **Fix Difficulty:** Medium (needs live site inspection)
- **Time:** 2-3 hours per scraper

### Issue #3: Article Link Discovery (BLOCKING DISCOVERY)
- **Problem:** Component class names outdated
- **Locations:** 3 scrapers
- **Impact:** Cannot find new articles
- **Fix Difficulty:** Medium (needs live site inspection)
- **Time:** 1-2 hours per scraper

## Key Findings

### Pattern 1: Multiple Versions Exist
- Some scrapers have both root and backend versions
- Root versions generally more robust (better error handling)
- Backend versions sometimes have different approach but more fragile

### Pattern 2: CSS Selectors Are Brittle
- Most selectors depend on specific class names
- Sites redesign and change class names frequently
- Root El Espectador's regex approach more flexible

### Pattern 3: No Verification
- Current selectors appear untested against live sites
- Estimated 60-75% of selectors likely need updates
- Browser inspection required before fixes

### Pattern 4: Fallback Chains Vary
- El Tiempo: Minimal fallbacks, returns wrong data
- Semana/Portafolio: Multiple fallbacks, good patterns
- Root El Espectador: Best patterns with meta tag fallbacks

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Recommended Approach (4 Phases)

**Phase 1: Inspection (2-3 hours)**
- Use browser DevTools on each site
- Document actual HTML structure
- Identify current class names and selectors

**Phase 2: Fixes (3-4 hours)**
- Parallel: Team A fixes code bugs
- Parallel: Team B updates selectors
- Reference: Known working patterns provided

**Phase 3: Validation (2 hours)**
- Test each scraper against real articles
- Verify extraction quality
- Document metrics

**Phase 4: Integration (1 hour)**
- Consolidate changes
- Update documentation
- Prepare for deployment

**Total Estimated Time: 8-10 hours**

## Questions & Answers

**Q: Where do I start if I'm a developer?**
A: Read SCRAPER_FIX_PRIORITIES.md, find your scraper, start with "Critical Issues" section.

**Q: Why are there two El Espectador versions?**
A: Root version is standalone, backend version integrates with SmartScraper base class. Root version is recommended.

**Q: How do I know if my fix works?**
A: Test against 3+ real articles using commands in SCRAPER_FIX_PRIORITIES.md, validate against success criteria.

**Q: What's the most critical issue to fix first?**
A: El Tiempo date parsing bug (line 238). It's a code bug, not dependent on site inspection, and breaks all articles.

**Q: How long will this take?**
A: Estimated 8-10 hours total with full team. Can be parallelized into ~4 hours wall-clock time.

**Q: What if a selector doesn't work?**
A: That's expected. Use browser DevTools to find current selector, then update code. Document what you find.
