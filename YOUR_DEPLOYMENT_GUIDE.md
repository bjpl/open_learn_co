## 🆘 **If You Get Stuck**

**Issue: Can't connect to Supabase**
```
Error: "Failed to connect to database"

Check:
1. Connection string is correct (from Supabase Settings → Database)
2. Password has no spaces or special characters that need escaping
3. Supabase project is active (green status in dashboard)

Fix:
- Copy connection string again from Supabase
- Paste fresh in Railway variables
- Railway redeploys automatically
```

**Issue: CORS errors in browser console**
```
Error: "Access to fetch blocked by CORS policy"

Check:
1. Railway variables: CORS_ORIGINS matches your Vercel URL EXACTLY
2. No trailing slash: https://openlearn.vercel.app ✅
3. NOT: https://openlearn.vercel.app/ ❌

Fix:
- Railway → Variables → CORS_ORIGINS
- Copy your exact Vercel URL (from browser address bar)
- Paste, save
- Wait 2 min for redeploy
```

**Issue: Emails not sending**
```
No emails arriving in inbox

Check:
1. SendGrid API key is correct in Railway variables
2. SendGrid sender email is verified
3. Check SendGrid dashboard → Activity → Email Activity

Fix:
- Verify sender in SendGrid
- Check spam folder
- Railway logs for email errors: Railway → Deployments → View Logs → Search "email"
```

**Issue: Frontend build fails**
```
Vercel shows: "Build failed"

Check:
1. Root directory is set to: frontend
2. Build command is: npm run build
3. Check build logs for specific error

Fix:
- Vercel → Settings → General → Root Directory: frontend
- Redeploy: Deployments → Three dots → Redeploy
```
