## 🏗️ Technical Debt Assessment

### High Priority Debt
1. **Missing Frontend Tests** (Critical)
   - 0% test coverage on all React components
   - No E2E tests configured
   - No component testing framework

2. **Incomplete Features** (High)
   - Data processing pipeline stubbed
   - Avatar upload not connected to backend
   - Health checks using placeholders

3. **Documentation Gaps** (Medium)
   - No API documentation for new endpoints
   - Missing deployment runbook
   - Outdated email service docs

### Code Quality Issues
```
Complexity Hotspots:
- backend/core/source_manager.py (259 lines, 2 TODOs)
- backend/scrapers/base/smart_scraper.py (complex inheritance)
- frontend/src/components/Dashboard.tsx (needs refactoring)

Missing Abstractions:
- Duplicate scraper logic across sources
- Repeated API client patterns
- No shared error handling utilities
```

### Dependency Concerns
- Several security updates applied recently
- Frontend has 60+ dependencies
- Some packages may be unused (needs audit)

---

## 🎯 Issue Tracking Review

### Implementation Plan (Weeks 2-3)
From `docs/weeks-2-3-implementation-plan.md`:

**Week 2 Goals:**
