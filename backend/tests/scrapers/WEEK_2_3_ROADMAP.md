**FeaturePlanner Agent Report**

## Week 2: Expand Test Coverage (Days 6-10)

### Day 6-7: Complete Unit Test Coverage
- [ ] Add edge case tests for all scrapers
- [ ] Test error recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks
- [ ] Test concurrent scraping scenarios

### Day 8-9: Integration Testing
- [ ] End-to-end scraper pipeline tests
- [ ] Database persistence tests
- [ ] Cache integration tests
- [ ] NLP pipeline integration

### Day 10: Documentation & CI/CD
- [ ] Generate coverage reports
- [ ] Document testing patterns
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions for tests
- [ ] Create test data fixtures

## Week 3: Production Readiness (Days 11-15)

### Day 11-12: Performance Testing
- [ ] Load testing with 100+ concurrent scrapers
- [ ] Memory leak detection
- [ ] Rate limiter stress testing
- [ ] Cache performance optimization

### Day 13-14: Security & Compliance
- [ ] Test robots.txt compliance
- [ ] Verify rate limit adherence
- [ ] Test data sanitization
- [ ] Security vulnerability scanning

### Day 15: Deployment & Monitoring
- [ ] Production deployment tests
- [ ] Health check implementation
- [ ] Monitoring setup
- [ ] Alert configuration

## Success Metrics

**Coverage Goals:**
- Unit Tests: 90%+ coverage
- Integration Tests: 80%+ coverage
- E2E Tests: Core flows covered

**Performance Targets:**
- Scraper response time < 2s
- Rate limiter overhead < 10ms
- Cache hit rate > 70%

**Quality Gates:**
- All tests passing in CI/CD
- No critical security issues
- Documentation complete
- Production deployment validated

## Next Immediate Actions

1. Run full test suite to establish baseline
2. Identify coverage gaps with coverage report
3. Prioritize critical path testing
4. Begin implementing remaining scrapers
